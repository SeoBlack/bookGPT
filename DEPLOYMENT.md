# BookGPT Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Environment Setup

- [ ] Set up production environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- [ ] Verify Pinecone API key is valid and index exists
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure `FRONTEND_URL` for your domain

### ✅ Security Configuration

- [ ] Review and update CORS settings for your domain
- [ ] Verify rate limiting settings (100 requests/15min)
- [ ] Check file upload limits (50MB max)
- [ ] Ensure all security headers are enabled
- [ ] Review API key permissions and scopes

### ✅ Infrastructure Requirements

- [ ] At least 1GB RAM available
- [ ] 10GB+ disk space for uploads and processing
- [ ] Network access to OpenAI and Pinecone APIs
- [ ] SSL certificate for HTTPS (recommended)

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your production values

# 2. Build and deploy
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Check logs
docker-compose logs -f bookgpt

# 4. Verify health
curl http://your-domain:3001/api/health
```

### Option 2: Traditional Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your production values

# 2. Install dependencies
npm ci --only=production

# 3. Build application
npm run build

# 4. Start server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### Option 3: PM2 Deployment

```bash
# 1. Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# 2. Set up environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your production values

# 3. Build application
npm run build

# 4. Start with PM2
pm2 start server.js --name bookgpt --env production
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] API endpoints are accessible

### ✅ Functionality Testing

- [ ] PDF upload works
- [ ] Text extraction functions properly
- [ ] Chat interface responds
- [ ] File cleanup works after processing

### ✅ Performance Monitoring

- [ ] Response times are acceptable (< 5s for uploads)
- [ ] Memory usage is stable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Rate limiting is working

### ✅ Security Verification

- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] File upload validation works
- [ ] Rate limiting is active

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks

- [ ] Application is responding
- [ ] No error logs
- [ ] API usage within limits
- [ ] Disk space available

### Weekly Checks

- [ ] Review application logs
- [ ] Check API usage and costs
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed

### Monthly Checks

- [ ] Review security settings
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits
- [ ] Review error patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application won't start**

   - Check environment variables
   - Verify port availability
   - Check Node.js version

2. **PDF upload fails**

   - Check file size limits
   - Verify file format
   - Check disk space

3. **Chat not working**

   - Verify OpenAI API key
   - Check Pinecone connection
   - Review rate limits

4. **Memory issues**
   - Increase Docker memory limits
   - Monitor large file uploads
   - Check for memory leaks

### Log Locations

```bash
# Docker logs
docker-compose logs bookgpt

# PM2 logs
pm2 logs bookgpt

# Direct logs
npm start
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Data Backup
